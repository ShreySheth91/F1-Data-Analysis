# 🏎️ Formula 1 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores and analyzes comprehensive Formula 1 datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about races, drivers, constructors, circuits, and car performance over the years — with a focus on the hybrid era (2014–present).

## 📂 Dataset

The data comes from the **[Ergast Developer API F1 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreysheth/f1-data)** which includes:
- Race results
- Driver standings
- Constructor results
- Circuit information
- Lap times, pit stops, qualifying sessions
- Status and reliability logs

---

## 📌 Objectives

- 🔍 Perform structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on F1 historical data.
- 🗺️ Analyze **circuits** by number of races hosted and how lap times evolved over the years.
- 🏁 Identify the **most reliable constructors** in the **hybrid era (2014–present)** based on DNF (Did Not Finish) rates.
- 📈 Visualize trends using bar plots and line charts to make results intuitive and presentable.
